Model: SARIMA
====================================
The SARIMA model is a time-series forecasting model.

- ARIMA captures short-term autocorrelation using AR (autoregression),
  I (integration/differencing), and MA (moving average).
- SARIMA extends ARIMA by modeling seasonality with seasonal components.

Graph Explanation:
- Blue line: Actual S&P500 values.
- Red dashed line: 30-day forecast.

Parameters in Table:
- AIC, BIC, HQIC: Information criteria (lower = better).
- No. of Observations: Data points used for fitting.
- Forecast Horizon: Number of future points predicted.

Inference:
- SARIMA can model complex temporal patterns.
- SARIMA is more robust for data with seasonality (e.g., monthly/quarterly cycles).
